# Wonderz Mediabox Unity SDK
Install this package using Unity's package manager:

Open `Window > Package Manager`

Click on the `+`-Button

Select `Add package from git URL...`

And paste this URL: `https://github.com/WonderzGmbH/Mediabox-UnityClient.git?path=/Assets/Plugins/Mediabox`

You should be able to see `Wonderz GmbH`'s `Wunderbox Unity SDK` in the Package Manager. Select `Download` and `Import` to import the package into your project.

For a Quick Start, import the Sample Files using the `Package Manager` and confirm the dialogues. You should see the `Game Definition Hub`, `Wunderbox Unity SDK`'s central Editor Window to configure your games for exporting and uploading (If not, open it manually using `Mediabox > Game Definition Hub`). And you'll be one click on `Start Play Mode` away to test `GameB`, one of the two "Games" included in the Samples, in Simulation Mode in the Unity Editor.

Congratulations on coming this far! Your next steps should be to click yourself through the imported Sample Scripts, have a look at the `Game Definition Hub` and try to use `Build All` to export your games in order to upload them to `Wunderbox`. Next, you can use `Mediabox > Build Game` to build your Unity Client and integrate it into your `Mediabox`-Client-Application. The `Wunderbox Unity SDK` will do all the work of communicating with the `Wunderbox Client` integrated in your native environment according to `Wunderbox' Native API`.
